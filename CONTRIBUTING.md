## Contribution Guidelines

### Pull Requests

* Never push directly to master. Always create a branch and push your changes to that branch. When your code is ready for review, [create a pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request/).
* Never force push your changes (e.g. `git push -f`). This is a destructive operation. If you need to revert changes, always use [`git revert`](http://git-scm.com/docs/git-revert)
* At least 2 people should sign off on every pull request before merging it in.

### Code Style

* Every source file should have the GPLv3 license header.
* If you make contributions to a source file, add your name and copyright year to the license header.
